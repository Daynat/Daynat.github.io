## Some heading 

Find Beautiful Meaning in Beautiful things.
I really need a space to clarify my wide scope of interest. I found it so hard to distinguished between the things I love from the deepest part of my mind and the things I find doing it is aligned with social standard or others' expectation. I am curious about everything but I notice more attention should be allocated to the issues that I am most good at, most interested in and want to dedicate my whole life to. That is the reason why I  create this blog. It is a mirror that reflect my interest and strength and hope the contents are interesting and helpful.
